Study: Identification of AI-Generated Academic Texts Using Watermarks

1. About the study 

You are invited to take part in a research study conducted by researchers from Ariel University and the Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT). The aim of this study is to develop test methods (“watermarks”) that help distinguish between academic texts written by humans and texts generated by large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and similar AI tools. As part of the project, we will examine both how AI-generated texts can be marked in subtle ways and how easily human users (students) can detect and potentially remove such marks when they edit or rewrite the text.  

You will be asked to use an experimental software interface that sends your queries to an AI text generator, receives the AI’s answer, and may embed special patterns (watermarks) in that answer. You will also be asked to read, edit, or rewrite AI-generated academic text to try to modify the embedded watermarks. 

Participation in this study is voluntary. The participants will be rewarded with 50 NIS upon completion of the experiment tasks. Please read the information below carefully before deciding whether to take part. 

2. What your participation involves 

If you agree to participate, you may be asked to: 

    Use a web-based or desktop interface to submit prompts/questions to an AI system and receive textual responses. 

    Read AI-generated academic texts that may contain hidden “watermarks”. 

    Indicate whether you think a given text contains a watermark or AI-generated content and provide your reasoning. 

    Edit or preserve texts, sometimes with the explicit goal of trying to remove or obscure possible watermarks. 

Your interactions with the system (e.g., prompts, AI outputs, edits, time stamps, and general usage logs) will be automatically recorded for research and analysis.  

3. Data collection, anonymity and monitoring 

By participating in this study: 

    Anonymous data collection 

    The data collected from your interactions with the system (e.g., text you type, AI responses, your edits and choices, timing information and general usage patterns) will be stored in a way that is not directly linked to your name or official student ID. 

    Where a linkage is temporarily needed (for example, to assign participation credit), it will be removed as early as possible, and any published results will be reported only in aggregate form (e.g., averages across many participants, not individual records). 

    Monitoring of activity with the AI system 

    The research team will monitor and analyze your activity within the research system only, in order to understand how participants use AI, how they detect or modify watermarks, and how robust different watermarking methods are.  

    This includes logging which buttons you click, what text you submit to the AI, what the AI returns, and how you modify that text. 

    These logs are used solely for the purposes of this research project and not for evaluating you as a student in any specific course. 

4. Academic integrity and non-prosecution clause 

This study may involve forms of AI use (for example, generating or rewriting academic-style text with an AI tool) that, outside the research setting, might be restricted or regulated by the academic integrity policies of Ariel University or JCT. 

To remove any concern about possible sanctions: 

    Your participation in this research, and any AI use that takes place within the research system and tasks, will not be used to initiate disciplinary, academic-integrity or misconduct proceedings against you by Ariel University, JCT, or any of their academic units. 

    The data we collect will not be shared with course instructors, departments, or disciplinary authorities in a way that could identify you personally or be used as evidence against you in any academic-integrity procedure. 

    Participation in this study is for research purposes only and is completely separate from your regular coursework, exams or assignments. 

However, this protection applies only to activities performed within this controlled research environment. You remain responsible for following all applicable academic integrity rules in your regular courses and assignments outside of this study. 

5. Possible risks and benefits 

    Risks: 

    There are no known physical risks. 

    You may feel mild discomfort or concern about being “monitored” while using the AI system. We address this by anonymizing data, limiting monitoring strictly to research purposes, and ensuring that none of this is used against you academically or disciplinarily. 

    Benefits: 

    You may gain insight into how AI text-generation and watermarking work. 

    Your participation will contribute to the development of better tools for managing AI use in higher education and for protecting academic integrity. 

    You will be compensated by 50 NIS upon completion of the experiment.  

6. Voluntary participation and right to withdraw 

    Your participation is entirely voluntary. 

    You may withdraw from the study at any time, without giving a reason and without any penalty to your grades, academic status or relationship with CSIC, Ariel University or JCT. 

    Withdrawal requests can be made as long as we are able to identify you via the email address you provided. Once your email address has been deleted (after compensation has been distributed) and your data has been anonymized, it will no longer be possible to identify or remove your individual data from the dataset. 

    If you withdraw, we will stop collecting new data from you. You may request that your previously collected data be deleted, unless it has already been fully anonymized and merged into aggregated analyses. 

    You would not be compensated for in this case. 

7. Confidentiality, data storage and publication 

    All research data will be stored securely on password-protected servers or encrypted storage, accessible only to the research team. 

    No identifying details (such as your name, ID number or email) will appear in any publication or presentation. Results will be reported only in anonymous, aggregated form.  

    The researchers intend to publish anonymized datasets and software tools for the benefit of the academic community. Any shared data will be fully anonymized so that individual participants cannot be identified.  

8. Ethics approval and contacts 

This study will be submitted for approval by the relevant ethics committees / Institutional Review Boards of Ariel University and JCT.
